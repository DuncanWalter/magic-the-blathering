    <p>This app was created with the intention of providing Magic the Gathering players a way to organize and keep digital collections of their cards in a way that they
    could be easily filtered and searched. Our application is designed to allow a user to create collections, add or remove cards, and move them around their
    created collections. <br>
    We also designed this application with store owners in mind who may wish to keep a digital inventory of cards available in the store for quick customer interaction and lookup times.</p>
